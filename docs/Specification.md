## Objective
i want to build an app, that might be able to detect the signs of AGI. This is my plan, ideas, inspiration below, assess the plan, suggest solutions and tell me the technical development for nextjs react step by step. Follow the sparc method: Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, and Completion.

Initial ideas:
the CEO of Conjure told  that AGI won't be a sudden occurence. It will be gradual.
The signs of AGI can be noticed, or maybe, maybe not, but the main thing is that I need a detector, somehow, you know, a system prompt that can search the web and, you know, search for signs.
To develop a system that can search for signs of AGI, you'd need a robust web crawler and a natural language processing system to sift through vast amounts of information. You'd be looking for trends in AI research, you'd want to set up a web crawler. This tool would scan the internet, pulling data from relevant sources like academic papers, news articles, and AI research blogs. Next, the natural language processing system would analyze this data, searching for key indicators of AGI development. We'd need to define those indicators based on current AI advancements.
draft plan: Set Up a Web Crawler, some key areas to monitor for political signs of AGI, Sure, aside from political signs, you can monitor for: [add here]

Research Breakthroughs, some other areas to keep an eye on: [add here]

Social Media Anomalies: Monitor for unusual patterns, viral content with unclear origins, or sudden shifts in discourse that could indicate manipulation by advanced AI.

Unattributed Software Releases: Keep track of new technologies or applications that emerge without clear authorship or origin, which could suggest an advanced, autonomous creator.

Rapid Advancements in AI Capabilities: Look for sudden leaps in AI performance, especially in areas like problem-solving, language understanding, or creativity that exceed current expectations.

AI Self-Replication: Watch for instances where AI systems are reported to improve or replicate themselves independently, a potential indicator of AGI.

Cross-Domain Learning: Identify reports of AI systems that can transfer knowledge across different fields, demonstrating a level of understanding closer to human general intelligence.

By monitoring these areas, you might catch early signs of AGI development

Several companies are at the forefront of advanced AI research and could be considered as potentially working towards AGI:

OpenAI: Known for developing GPT models and heavily investing in AGI research with a focus on ensuring its benefits are broadly shared.

DeepMind (a subsidiary of Alphabet/Google): Famous for creating AI that mastered games like Go, they are deeply involved in research pushing towards AGI.

Microsoft: With their investment in OpenAI and their own AI research labs, Microsoft is a key player in advancing AI capabilities.

IBM: With a long history in AI through Watson, IBM continues to explore AI's frontiers, including aspects related to AGI.

Anthropic: Founded by former OpenAI researchers, this company focuses on AI safety and advancing AI capabilities, which could contribute to AGI.


## Purpose
You want to build a web application that can:

Crawl (or fetch) data from relevant sources, Use tools like Perplexity:

AI news sites, research journals, company blogs.
Social media platforms.
Political or policy sites for signs of advanced AI influences.
Analyze the collected data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) or other AI-driven methods to detect certain patterns or “indicators” of AGI such as:

Unexplained leaps in AI performance.
AI systems self-replicating or self-improving.
Autonomy or cross-domain knowledge.
Anomalous social media patterns suggesting advanced AI manipulation.
Present these findings on a user-friendly dashboard, highlighting potential “red flags” or relevant discussion topics.

Key Requirements
Core functionalities:

Web crawler integration: A background service or script that periodically crawls or consumes APIs from relevant sites.
Data ingestion & storage: Store crawled data in a suitable database.
NLP/AI pipeline: Analyze the text for potential AGI indicators.
Alerting & Visualization: Provide a dashboard or UI alerts where suspicious content is flagged.
Tech stack:

Frontend: Next.js (React-based framework).
Backend: Next.js API routes (or a separate Node.js server if needed).
Database: A NoSQL store (MongoDB or similar) or a relational DB if desired.
NLP: Could use a Python microservice (FastAPI, Flask) or a Node-based library. Alternatively, integrate with third-party NLP APIs (e.g., Hugging Face Inference API).
Security & Privacy:

Properly handle large-scale scraping requests (respect robots.txt, rate limiting).
Ensure you have permission or abide by fair-use policies.
Scalability:

Plan for potentially large volumes of data.
Automated scheduling for crawls.
Caching and indexing strategies.
