# Architecture

Architecture
Below is a typical architecture flow for a Next.js + Node-based solution:


                +---------------------------------+
                |           Frontend (UI)         |
                |  Next.js React pages and hooks  |
                |   (e.g. /dashboard, /alerts )   |
                +----------------^-----------------+
                                 |
                                 | (HTTP/HTTPS, API calls)
                                 v
                +---------------------------------+
                |       Next.js API Routes        |
                |   or a separate Node.js server  |
                +----------------^-----------------+
                                 |
     +---------------------------+----------------------------+
     |                          |                            |
     |                          |                            |
     v                          v                            v
+---------+               +-------------+              +--------------+
| Web     |               | Social Media|              | NLP Service  |
| Crawler |               | APIs        |              |  (e.g. HF)   |
+---------+               +-------------+              +--------------+
     |                          |                            |
     |                          | (Fetched or crawled data)   |
     |                          v                            |
     +------------------------------------------------------+
                               |
                               v
                       +-------------------+
                       | Database (Mongo) |
                       +-------------------+
                               |
                               v
                  +----------------------------------+
                  | Aggregated & Processed Data      |
                  +----------------------------------+
                               |
                               v
                         [Dashboard UI]




Frontend (Next.js):

Pages: index.js for home, dashboard.js for analysis results, alerts.js for flagged items.
React components to display real-time flagged data.
Next.js API Routes:

Could have routes like POST /api/crawl, GET /api/results, GET /api/flagged.
Integrate a schedule or call out to a serverless function (or cron job) that crawls data.
Crawler:

A separate microservice or script that runs periodically (via cron, GitHub Actions, or a job scheduler) to scrape or fetch data from AI sources & social media.
Possibly store data in the DB, setting processed: false initially.
NLP Service:

Could be integrated into the Node server or run as a separate Python-based service if you use Python libraries like spaCy, transformers, or specialized ML.
The NLP pipeline marks documents as flagged or not flagged based on your “indicators.”
Database:

Store raw text documents, analysis results, and logs of suspicious findings.
MongoDB recommended for flexibility with semi-structured data.



## Architectural Style
- **Monolithic Architecture:** Provides a straightforward structure suitable for small to medium-sized applications.

## System Architecture Diagram
![Architecture Diagram](architecture_diagram.png)

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Database:** In-memory (for simplicity; can be replaced with PostgreSQL or another database as needed)
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens
- **Containerization:** Docker

## Data Models and Schemas



## Key Components
- **API Endpoints:** Handling HTTP requests related to users and tasks.
- **Data Storage:** Managing in-memory data persistence for users and tasks.


## Reflection

- **In-Memory Database:** Chosen for simplicity in the sample project; recommended to use a persistent database for production.
- **Possible Enhancements:** Integrate a database like PostgreSQL, implement more robust authentication mechanisms, and add more comprehensive error handling.
