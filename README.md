4. **Set up the database**:
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

5. **Run the development server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

### üéØ Quick Start Tips

1. **First Run**:
   - Click "Run Manual Scan" to crawl all sources
   - The system will automatically analyze articles for AGI indicators
   - Check the console output at the bottom for progress

2. **Cost Optimization**:
   - The system uses GPT-4.1-mini which is very cost-efficient
   - Each analysis costs ~$0.001 (1000 analyses ‚âà $1)
   - Firecrawl free tier is sufficient for daily monitoring

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If sources show 0 articles, check your Firecrawl API key
   - Database connection errors: Verify your DATABASE_URL format
   - OpenAI errors: Ensure your API key has credits

### üîí Security Notes

**CRITICAL: Protect Your API Keys**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER** commit `.env` or `.env.local` files to version control
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep your OpenAI, database, and other API keys secure and private
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For production deployments, use environment variables from your hosting platform

**Security Features (October 2025 Update):**
- ‚úÖ SSRF protection - blocks localhost, private IPs, and cloud metadata endpoints
- ‚úÖ Safe JSON parsing - prevents crashes from malformed responses
- ‚úÖ Input validation - all API parameters validated with Zod schemas
- ‚úÖ Request limits - 1MB body size, 10MB response size, 30s timeouts
- ‚úÖ Security headers - X-Frame-Options, XSS protection, content-type sniffing protection
- ‚úÖ Browser security - Playwright runs without dangerous --disable-web-security flags
- ‚úÖ SQL injection protection - Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- ‚úÖ Regular dependency updates - automated security patch management

**Best Practices for Users:**
1. **API Keys**: Use separate keys for development/production, rotate regularly
2. **Network**: Only crawl trusted public sources (default configuration is safe)
3. **Updates**: Run `npm update` and `npm audit fix` regularly for security patches
4. **Monitoring**: Watch for unusual API usage or costs
5. **Local Only**: This tool is for local use; don't expose APIs publicly without authentication

**For Security Issues:**
See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for our security policy and how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

### üóÑÔ∏è Database (Prisma) Notes
- If `DATABASE_URL` is not set, the server runs in a no-DB mode. API routes like `/api/data` and `/api/trends` return empty arrays so you can exercise the UI and crawling/analysis flows without persistence.
- To enable persistence locally:
  1) Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`.
  2) Run `npx prisma generate`.
  3) Run `npx prisma db push` (or `npx prisma migrate dev`).

## üï∑Ô∏è Web Crawling Implementation

### Advanced Crawling Features
The AGI Detector uses a sophisticated multi-strategy crawling system to bypass blocking and collect data from various sources:

#### Crawling Strategies (in order of attempt):
1. **RSS Feed Parsing**: Primary method for most sources
   - Fastest and most reliable
   - No blocking issues
   - Structured data format

2. **Advanced HTTP Requests**: Fallback with stealth headers
   - User agent rotation
   - Browser-like headers
   - Cookie support
   - Automatic decompression

3. **Brave Web Search (New)**: Site-restricted fallback via Brave Search API
   - Query form: `site:<host> [source-specific keywords]`
   - Normalizes results to article candidates (title, snippet, URL)
   - Honors a short TTL cache and minimal rate-limiting
   - Requires `BRAVE_API_KEY`

4. **Firecrawl API**: For heavily protected sources
   - Professional web scraping service
   - Handles JavaScript rendering
   - Bypasses most anti-bot measures
   - Limited to 50 requests/day (cached for 24h)

5. **Browser Automation**: Last resort using Playwright
   - Full JavaScript rendering
   - Stealth plugins to avoid detection
   - Random viewport sizes
   - Human-like delays

#### Working Sources:
- ‚úÖ **OpenAI Blog**: ~500 articles via RSS feed
- ‚úÖ **DeepMind Research**: ~100 articles via advanced crawling
- ‚úÖ **Anthropic Blog**: 3+ articles via Firecrawl API
- ‚úÖ **Microsoft AI Blog**: ~30 articles via RSS feed  
- ‚úÖ **TechCrunch AI**: ~60 articles via RSS feed
- ‚úÖ **VentureBeat AI**: ~90 articles via RSS feed
- ‚úÖ **arXiv AI**: ~200 articles via HTML parsing

### Crawler Configuration
The crawler includes:
- **Rate Limiting**: 1 request per 2 seconds
- **Random Delays**: 2-5 seconds between requests
- **User Agent Pool**: Rotates through real browser user agents
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper browser instance management

# Test all sources
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/crawl | jq

# Test specific source
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-crawler \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": {
      "name": "OpenAI Blog",
      "url": "https://openai.com/blog",
      "selector": ".ui-list__item",
      "titleSelector": ".ui-title-text",
      "contentSelector": ".prose",
      "linkSelector": "a"
    }
  }' | jq
```

## üßØ Troubleshooting: Analyze-All Hangs / Timeouts

If clicking "Run Manual Scan" leads to a long spinner and no results, it‚Äôs often due to the analysis phase (`POST /api/analyze-all`) waiting on external services. We‚Äôve hardened the endpoint to avoid indefinite hangs and added tunable timeouts.

What typically causes the delay
- OpenAI API timeouts during batch analysis (most common). You‚Äôll see logs like:
  - `[Analyze] Error type: APIConnectionTimeoutError` and `Request timed out.`
- Database latency or connection issues when reading/writing analyses.

How it‚Äôs mitigated in code
- Per‚Äëstep timeouts and fast‚Äëfail handling in `src/app/api/analyze-all/route.ts`:
  - DB reads/writes: 10‚Äì15s cap with clear log messages.
  - OpenAI analysis: explicit per‚Äërequest timeout and no automatic retries.
  - Batch processing: `Promise.allSettled` with a per‚Äëbatch timeout so one slow item doesn‚Äôt stall the whole request.
- On timeout, the API returns HTTP 504 with an array of `logs` instead of hanging.

Environment tuning (recommended for dev)
- Add these to `.env.local` to speed up responses and reduce timeouts:
  - `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` (fast, reliable)
  - `OPENAI_TIMEOUT_MS=12000` (per‚Äërequest timeout)
  - `ANALYZE_BATCH_SIZE=2` (lower concurrency)
  - `BATCH_TIMEOUT_MS=18000` (per‚Äëbatch cap)

Quick diagnostics
- Check OpenAI reachability:
  - `curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/test-openai` should return a short message.
- Check DB health:
  - `curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/db-health` should be 200 with counts; 503 means no DB configured.
- Exercise analyze-all with a client timeout:
  - `curl -i -m 45 -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze-all`
  - Expect 200 with results or 504 within ~20‚Äì40s with a JSON body including `logs`.

Reading the last log line
- Last line is ‚ÄúAbout to query database‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí DB `findMany` is stalling (pooling/network/statement timeout).
- Shows ‚ÄúFound X unanalyzed articles‚Äù then ‚ÄúProcessing batch ‚Ä¶‚Äù with repeated OpenAI timeouts ‚Üí reduce `ANALYZE_BATCH_SIZE`, increase `OPENAI_TIMEOUT_MS`, or switch model.
- Timeouts during `DB create(analysisResult)`/`createMany(historicalData)` ‚Üí investigate DB write latency; consider Neon pooled connection and statement timeout.

Notes
- The crawl step (`POST /api/crawl`) can be long, but it now runs independent of analysis timeouts. The UI triggers analyze-all after crawling; with the settings above, analysis should no longer block indefinitely.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Security
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use environment variables from your hosting platform in production

### Rate Limiting
- Crawler implements 2-5 second delays between requests
- OpenAI API calls are rate-limited to 1 per second
- Advanced rate limiter using token bucket algorithm
- Respects robots.txt via proxy configuration

### Crawler Dependencies
The advanced crawler requires:
- `playwright`: Browser automation
- `limiter`: Rate limiting
- `user-agents`: User agent rotation
- `xml2js`: RSS feed parsing

### Data Accuracy & Privacy
- This is an experimental system for research purposes
- Should not be relied upon as the sole indicator of AGI emergence
- Designed to supplement, not replace, expert analysis
- Article content is sent to OpenAI for analysis - review OpenAI's data policy
- URLs are accessed via Firecrawl and Brave Search APIs when configured
- All data stays in your local database; no telemetry or external reporting
