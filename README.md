[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

An advanced monitoring system designed to detect early signs of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) emergence by analyzing patterns across AI research labs, academic papers, and technology news.

## ✨ Recent Improvements
- **Layer-0 noise filter**: Cheap triage skips obvious non-capability updates before LLM analysis.
- **Evidence-gated severity**: Critical alerts require real benchmark deltas to reduce false positives.
- **Corroboration penalties**: Unverified high-claims get a score penalty during validation.
- **Score transparency**: UI shows model vs heuristic scores, secrecy boost, evidence counts, and penalties.
- **Smarter anomalies**: Source-grouped clustering + minimum AGI score threshold reduce noise.
- **CJK normalization**: Chinese text gets tokenization support and optional translation for consistent indicators.
- **Playwright retries**: Gated sources use Playwright with retries for better coverage.
- **Correlation MVP**: Cross-source co-occurrence of indicators + benchmark deltas surfaced on Overview.
- **LLM Insights**: Natural-language synthesis across sources with grounded URLs.

## 🧭 Roadmap (Next)
- Improve selectors and stability for China lab pages (BAAI, ByteDance Seed, Tencent AI Lab, Shanghai AI Lab).
- Add ChinaXiv parsing refinements (author/date extraction + canonicalization).
- Expand bilingual evidence extraction + translation for mixed Chinese/English releases.
- Add learning loop (ruvector or agentdb): feedback-driven retrain or reranker to adapt thresholds over time.
- Correlations v2: embedding-based clustering across sources + time-windowed co-movement detection.
- Correlations v3: LLM synthesis over correlation clusters + anomaly alignment for context.

psql -d your_database -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"

# Tables are auto-created on first API call
# For Neon/Supabase, pgvector is pre-installed
```

5. **Run the development server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

### 🎯 Quick Start Tips

1. **First Run**:
   - Click "Run Manual Scan" to crawl all sources
   - The system will automatically analyze articles for AGI indicators
   - Check the console output at the bottom for progress

2. **Cost Optimization**:
   - The system uses GPT-4.1-mini which is very cost-efficient
   - Each analysis costs ~$0.001 (1000 analyses ≈ $1)
   - No paid API required for crawling (Playwright handles blocked sources)

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If sources show 0 articles, ensure Playwright browsers are installed (`npx playwright install chromium`)
   - Database connection errors: Verify your DATABASE_URL format
   - OpenAI errors: Ensure your API key has credits

### 🔒 Security Notes

**CRITICAL: Protect Your API Keys**
- ⚠️ **NEVER** commit `.env` or `.env.local` files to version control
- ⚠️ Keep your OpenAI, database, and other API keys secure and private
- ⚠️ For production deployments, use environment variables from your hosting platform

**Security Features (October 2025 Update):**
- ✅ SSRF protection - blocks localhost, private IPs, and cloud metadata endpoints
- ✅ Safe JSON parsing - prevents crashes from malformed responses
- ✅ Input validation - all API parameters validated with Zod schemas
- ✅ Request limits - 1MB body size, 10MB response size, 30s timeouts
- ✅ Security headers - X-Frame-Options, XSS protection, content-type sniffing protection
- ✅ Browser security - Playwright runs without dangerous --disable-web-security flags
- ✅ SQL injection protection - parameterized queries via pg library
- ✅ Regular dependency updates - automated security patch management

**Best Practices for Users:**
1. **API Keys**: Use separate keys for development/production, rotate regularly
2. **Network**: Only crawl trusted public sources (default configuration is safe)
3. **Updates**: Run `npm update` and `npm audit fix` regularly for security patches
4. **Monitoring**: Watch for unusual API usage or costs
5. **Local Only**: This tool is for local use; don't expose APIs publicly without authentication

**For Security Issues:**
See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for our security policy and how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

### 🗄️ Database Notes
- If `DATABASE_URL` is not set, the server runs in a no-DB mode. API routes like `/api/data` and `/api/trends` return empty arrays so you can exercise the UI and crawling/analysis flows without persistence.
- To enable persistence locally:
  1) Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`.
  2) Tables are auto-created on first API call.
  3) For pgvector support, run: `psql -d your_db -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"`

## 🕷️ Web Crawling Implementation

### Advanced Crawling Features
The AGI Detector uses a sophisticated multi-strategy crawling system to bypass blocking and collect data from various sources:

#### Crawling Strategies (in order of attempt):
1. **RSS Feed Parsing**: Primary method for most sources
   - Fastest and most reliable
   - No blocking issues
   - Structured data format

2. **Advanced HTTP Requests**: Fallback with stealth headers
   - User agent rotation
   - Browser-like headers
   - Cookie support
   - Automatic decompression

3. **Brave Web Search (New)**: Site-restricted fallback via Brave Search API
   - Query form: `site:<host> [source-specific keywords]`
   - Normalizes results to article candidates (title, snippet, URL)
   - Honors a short TTL cache and minimal rate-limiting
   - Requires `BRAVE_API_KEY`

4. **Browser Automation**: Primary for JavaScript-heavy sites (Playwright)
   - Full JavaScript rendering
   - Stealth plugins to avoid detection
   - Random viewport sizes
   - Human-like delays

#### Working Sources:
- ✅ **OpenAI Blog**: ~500 articles via RSS feed
- ✅ **DeepMind Research**: ~90 articles via Playwright browser automation
- ✅ **Anthropic Blog**: ~16 articles via Playwright (React SPA)
- ✅ **Microsoft AI Blog**: ~30 articles via RSS feed
- ✅ **TechCrunch AI**: ~60 articles via RSS feed
- ✅ **VentureBeat AI**: ~90 articles via RSS feed
- ✅ **arXiv AI**: ~200 articles via HTML parsing

### Crawler Configuration
The crawler includes:
- **Rate Limiting**: 1 request per 2 seconds
- **Random Delays**: 2-5 seconds between requests
- **User Agent Pool**: Rotates through real browser user agents
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper browser instance management

  }' | jq
```

## 🧯 Troubleshooting: Analyze-All Hangs / Timeouts

If clicking "Run Manual Scan" leads to a long spinner and no results, it’s often due to the analysis phase (`POST /api/analyze-all`) waiting on external services. We’ve hardened the endpoint to avoid indefinite hangs and added tunable timeouts.

What typically causes the delay
- OpenAI API timeouts during batch analysis (most common). You’ll see logs like:
  - `[Analyze] Error type: APIConnectionTimeoutError` and `Request timed out.`
- Database latency or connection issues when reading/writing analyses.

How it’s mitigated in code
- Per‑step timeouts and fast‑fail handling in `src/app/api/analyze-all/route.ts`:
  - DB reads/writes: 10–15s cap with clear log messages.
  - OpenAI analysis: explicit per‑request timeout and no automatic retries.
  - Batch processing: `Promise.allSettled` with a per‑batch timeout so one slow item doesn’t stall the whole request.
- On timeout, the API returns HTTP 504 with an array of `logs` instead of hanging.

Environment tuning (recommended for dev)
- Add these to `.env.local` to speed up responses and reduce timeouts:
  - `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` (fast, reliable)
  - `OPENAI_TIMEOUT_MS=12000` (per‑request timeout)
  - `ANALYZE_BATCH_SIZE=2` (lower concurrency)
  - `BATCH_TIMEOUT_MS=18000` (per‑batch cap)

Quick diagnostics
- Check OpenAI reachability:
  - `curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/test-openai` should return a short message.
- Check DB health:
  - `curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/db-health` should be 200 with counts; 503 means no DB configured.
- Exercise analyze-all with a client timeout:
  - `curl -i -m 45 -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze-all`
  - Expect 200 with results or 504 within ~20–40s with a JSON body including `logs`.

Reading the last log line
- Last line is “About to query database…” → DB `findMany` is stalling (pooling/network/statement timeout).
- Shows “Found X unanalyzed articles” then “Processing batch …” with repeated OpenAI timeouts → reduce `ANALYZE_BATCH_SIZE`, increase `OPENAI_TIMEOUT_MS`, or switch model.
- Timeouts during `DB create(analysisResult)`/`createMany(historicalData)` → investigate DB write latency; consider Neon pooled connection and statement timeout.

Notes
- The crawl step (`POST /api/crawl`) can be long, but it now runs independent of analysis timeouts. The UI triggers analyze-all after crawling; with the settings above, analysis should no longer block indefinitely.

## 🔍 Vector Search (pgvector)

The system uses pgvector for semantic similarity search:

**Status:**
- ✅ pgvector extension enabled
- ✅ 512-dimensional embeddings via `text-embedding-3-small`
- ✅ HNSW index for fast similarity queries
- ⚠️ Embeddings generated on-demand (not auto during analysis)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check embedding status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/backfill-embeddings

# Generate missing embeddings (~$0.02 for 1000 articles)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/backfill-embeddings

# Find similar articles
curl http://localhost:3000/api/similar?id=<analysis-uuid>
```

**Future Plans:**
- Auto-generate embeddings during analysis
- Semantic search UI
- Anomaly detection (find outliers)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use environment variables from your hosting platform in production

### Rate Limiting
- Crawler implements 2-5 second delays between requests
- OpenAI API calls are rate-limited to 1 per second
- Advanced rate limiter using token bucket algorithm
- Respects robots.txt via proxy configuration

### Crawler Dependencies
The advanced crawler requires:
- `playwright`: Browser automation
- `limiter`: Rate limiting
- `user-agents`: User agent rotation
- `xml2js`: RSS feed parsing

### Data Accuracy & Privacy
- This is an experimental system for research purposes
- Should not be relied upon as the sole indicator of AGI emergence
- Designed to supplement, not replace, expert analysis
- Article content is sent to OpenAI for analysis - review OpenAI's data policy
- URLs are accessed via Firecrawl and Brave Search APIs when configured
- All data stays in your local database; no telemetry or external reporting

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy

### Docker
```bash
docker build -t agi-detector .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.local agi-detector
